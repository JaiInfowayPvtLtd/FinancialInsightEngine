FEDERAL RESERVE press release

Recent Developments
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. 

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.

Recent Economic Developments
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has slowed but remains somewhat elevated.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.

The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Outlook and Risk Assessment
The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Participants discussed the trajectory of monetary policy regarding the federal funds rate, noting that the appropriate time for policy rate reductions would depend on incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook and balance of risks.

Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace during the first quarter of this year. Household spending softened somewhat but continues to grow, though spending on housing services and consumer durables has eased somewhat. Recent indicators suggest that business fixed investment has continued to rise. Higher mortgage rates have reduced housing affordability.

Labor Market Conditions
The labor market has cooled compared with previous years but remains relatively tight. The pace of job gains has moderated, and the unemployment rate has moved up from its cyclical low but remains below pre-pandemic levels. The labor force participation rate has increased, though labor supply remains constrained for certain industries and skill categories.

Inflation Developments
Inflation has continued its gradual decline toward the Committee's 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices increased 2.7 percent. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent over the same period. The inflation rate for goods has declined faster than for services, as supply chains have normalized and demand has shifted back toward services.

The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and is prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.

Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.
